Log and view all WP HTTP requests

== Description ==

= Log and view all WP HTTP requests =

How long do [core / plugin / theme] update checks take to run? What data about my site is being sent out? What about all those ajax requests? The answers to these questions are just a few clicks away.

This plugin logs all WP_HTTP requests and displays them in a table listing for easy viewing. It also stores the runtime of each HTTP request.
